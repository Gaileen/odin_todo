# odin_todo
The Todo List webpage project assignment in Odin's JS course.

Due to time constraints (as of 10/8), I have ommitted the
remove button for Todo items and priority markings.

Aside from missing features, existing bugs I have noticed:
1. Page styling when scroll is enabled (paint not covering bottom)
2. Dropdown select has an undefined option.
3. Completed status needs to also update/resave localStorage proj_list objs.
